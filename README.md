# google-homepage
The very first Odin Project assignment. In this assignment, the task was to recreate the google homepage using HTML
and CSS. Throughout the assignment, I learned how to position elements using divs and target specific elements using
classes and ids. Additionally, I gained experience using Chrome Dev Tools and the ease it provides the user during
web development.
